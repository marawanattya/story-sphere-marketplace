# Welcome to my project

Core Technologies:

React: The presence of .tsx files in the src directory (e.g., App.tsx, HomePage.tsx, BookDetails.tsx) indicates that this project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: The .ts and .tsx file extensions show that the project is using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. This helps catch errors during development and provides better code organization.
Vite: vite.config.ts points to Vite as the build tool. Vite is a fast build tool that provides a development server with hot module replacement (HMR) and optimizes the build for production.
Tailwind CSS: The presence of tailwind.config.ts and postcss.config.js suggests that the project is using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It provides pre-defined CSS classes that you can use directly in your HTML/JSX to style your components.
Node.js: package.json and package-lock.json are indicators of a Node.js project. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side and use npm (Node Package Manager) for dependency management.
File Structure and Components:

src/: This is the main source directory where most of your application code resides.
src/App.tsx: The main application component, likely the entry point of your React application.
src/index.css and src/App.css: Global and component-specific CSS styles.
src/main.tsx: The entry point for rendering your React application to the DOM.
src/vite-env.d.ts: TypeScript declaration file for Vite environment variables.
src/components/: This directory likely contains reusable React components. You have components like AuthModal, BookCard, HomePage, Navbar, and ShoppingCart, suggesting an e-commerce or book-related application.
src/pages/: This directory might contain components that represent different pages of your application (e.g., BookDetails, Index, NotFound).
src/hooks/: This directory probably contains custom React hooks for reusable logic (e.g., use-mobile.tsx for mobile responsiveness, use-toast.ts for displaying notifications).
src/lib/: This directory could contain utility functions or helper modules (e.g., utils.ts).
src/utils/: Similar to src/lib/, this directory might contain utility functions (e.g., database.ts for database interactions).
src/components/ui/: This directory contains a large number of files, indicating the use of a UI library or a set of custom UI components. These components cover various UI elements like buttons, forms, dialogs, navigation menus, etc.
src/data/: This directory seems to contain data files.
src/data/mockData.ts: This file likely holds mock data for testing or development purposes.
src/data/database/: This directory contains JSON files (books.json, categories.json, orders.json, users.json), suggesting that you are using JSON files as a simple database or for storing static data.
Other Configuration Files:

.idx/dev.nix: This file is related to Nix, a package manager and system configuration tool. It might be used to define the development environment for the project.
components.json: This file might be related to a component library or a tool that manages UI components.
eslint.config.js: Configuration file for ESLint, a linter that helps enforce code style and identify potential errors.
index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your web application.
README.md: Provides a description of the project and instructions on how to set it up and run it.
tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.node.json: TypeScript configuration files that define compiler options and project settings.
In summary, this project is a React application built with TypeScript, using Vite for building, Tailwind CSS for styling, and likely utilizing a UI component library. It appears to be an e-commerce or book-related application based on the component and data files.
